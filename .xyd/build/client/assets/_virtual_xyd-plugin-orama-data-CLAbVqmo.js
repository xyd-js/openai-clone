Model prompting behavior between snapshots is subject to change. Model outputs are by their nature variable, so expect changes in prompting and model behavior between snapshots. For example, if you moved from gpt-4o-2024-05-13 to gpt-4o-2024-08-06, the same system or user messages could function differently between versions. The best way to ensure consistent prompting behavior and model output is to use pinned model versions, and to implement evals for your applications.
